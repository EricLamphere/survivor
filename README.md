# Survivor Pool
Survivor pool application for choosing survivors, calculating winnings, and looking at historical records


## Rules
* Everyone picks a player at the end of the first episode
    * All picks must be completed before the start of the second episode
    * We use NFL draft rules, meaning the winner of the previous season picks last, etc.
        * Amendment #1: New people are placed at the bottom of the list after the previous seasons winner in a first come first serve fashion
* Whosever person lasts the longest wins
* The loser pays $1 per day for each additional day the winner lasted compared to the player they chose
* If the winners player is the sole survivor, then each loser must pay an additional $5 to the winner
* If two players survivors are voted off the same day, the player who picked first in the current season will pick second in the following season
